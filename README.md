============

DANS DBF Library - Read and write DBF database files.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Java library to read and write the contents of old [DBF] (dBase) databases. It was produced for the [MIXED] project.
It is no longer maintained. You are however free to fork it, if you wish. 

There are no JavaDocs online, but they can be built locally with `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. After this they should 
be available at `<project dir>/target/site/apidocs/index.html`. (**Note: currently the JavaDocs are not correct, so the previous command 
will fail**.)
